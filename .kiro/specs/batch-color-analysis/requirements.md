# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive HD CMYK color matching and analysis system that provides professional-grade color correction capabilities for print production workflows. The system enables users to compare target colors against press measurements, perform batch analysis of color patches, generate correction suggestions, and maintain color libraries for consistent brand color management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a print production manager, I want to compare target LAB values against press measurements and receive ΔE calculations, so that I can quickly assess color accuracy and make informed correction decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs target LAB values (L*, a*, b*) THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the input within appropriate ranges (L*: 0-100, a*: -128 to 128, b*: -128 to 128)
2. WHEN a user inputs press LAB values (L*, a*, b*) THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the input within the same ranges
3. WHEN both target and press values are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate ΔE76, ΔE94, and ΔE2000 values
4. WHEN ΔE values are calculated THEN the system SHALL display color-coded badges (pass/warn/fail) based on configurable tolerance levels
5. WHEN tolerance is exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on press-side corrections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a color technician, I want to input CMYKOGV ink percentages alongside LAB values, so that I can see approximate color swatches and receive ink correction suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs CMYKOGV values (0-100% each) THEN the system SHALL generate approximate color swatches
2. WHEN CMYKOGV values are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate suggested ink corrections based on LAB differences
3. WHEN corrections are calculated THEN the system SHALL display delta values and new percentages for each ink channel
4. WHEN substrate type is selected THEN the system SHALL apply substrate-specific correction weights and characteristics
5. IF an ICC profile is loaded THEN the system SHALL use ICC-based color conversion for more accurate swatch display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality control operator, I want to import CSV files with multiple color measurements and visualize them in a grid with heatmap, so that I can quickly identify problematic areas across a print run.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CSV file with L*, a*, b* columns THEN the system SHALL parse and import the data
2. WHEN CSV data is imported THEN the system SHALL create a configurable grid (4×6, 6×8, or 10×10) of color patches
3. WHEN grid is populated THEN the system SHALL calculate ΔE2000 for each patch automatically
4. WHEN ΔE values are calculated THEN the system SHALL generate a color-coded heatmap visualization
5. WHEN a user clicks on any grid cell THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of LAB values
6. WHEN grid data changes THEN the system SHALL update the heatmap in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a color specialist, I want to compute and apply Color Correction Matrices (CCM) from paired target/press charts, so that I can systematically correct color drift across multiple patches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads target and press CSV files with matching patch counts THEN the system SHALL compute a 3×3 CCM using least squares regression
2. WHEN CCM computation succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the matrix coefficients
3. WHEN a user applies CCM THEN the system SHALL transform press LAB values using the computed matrix
4. WHEN CCM fails due to insufficient data THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging
5. IF the system has grid data THEN the auto-balance feature SHALL apply CCM plus gray axis correction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want to maintain a searchable library of approved brand colors with their LAB values per substrate, so that I can ensure consistent color reproduction across different print jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports a JSON library file THEN the system SHALL load color entries with name, code, LAB values, and substrate information
2. WHEN a user searches by name or code THEN the system SHALL filter and display matching entries with color swatches
3. WHEN a user clicks on a library entry THEN the system SHALL populate the target LAB fields automatically
4. WHEN a user exports the library THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable JSON file
5. WHEN library entries are displayed THEN the system SHALL show approximate color swatches based on LAB values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a press operator, I want to load ICC profiles for accurate color preview and soft proofing, so that I can better predict how colors will appear on different substrates and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads an ICC profile (.icc/.icm) THEN the system SHALL parse RGB matrix/TRC v2 profiles
2. WHEN ICC profile is loaded THEN the system SHALL use it for color swatch generation instead of approximate RGB conversion
3. WHEN substrate parameters are adjusted (dot gain, paper tint) THEN the system SHALL update the soft proof preview
4. WHEN DeviceLink CSV is provided THEN the system SHALL use it for CMYK to LAB conversion
5. IF ICC parsing fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to approximate color conversion with error notification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a production supervisor, I want to connect to a folder that receives spectrophotometer CSV exports for automatic ingestion, so that I can streamline the measurement workflow without manual file handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser supports File System Access API THEN the system SHALL offer folder connection capability
2. WHEN a folder is connected THEN the system SHALL monitor for new CSV files automatically
3. WHEN new CSV files are detected THEN the system SHALL auto-ingest them into the grid system
4. WHEN File System Access is not available THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality as fallback
5. WHEN files are ingested THEN the system SHALL update the grid and heatmap automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality manager, I want to maintain client-specific profiles with custom tolerances and SOPs, so that I can ensure each client's specific requirements are met consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a client profile THEN the system SHALL store tolerance levels, notes, and custom SOP checklists
2. WHEN a client profile is selected THEN the system SHALL apply the client's tolerance settings automatically
3. WHEN SOP items are defined THEN the system SHALL display them as checkboxes for operator verification
4. WHEN client profiles are saved THEN the system SHALL persist them in browser localStorage
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include client-specific SOP completion status

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a color technician, I want to track measurement history and generate statistical summaries, so that I can monitor process stability and identify trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically log timestamp, ΔE values, LAB values, and substrate information
2. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display recent measurements in chronological order
3. WHEN grid analysis is active THEN the system SHALL calculate and display median, 95th percentile, and maximum ΔE values
4. WHEN statistical thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators (color-coded badges)
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include measurement history and statistical summaries

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a print operator, I want a quick color converter for common color spaces (HEX, RGB, CMYK, LAB), so that I can quickly translate color specifications between different systems and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs HEX color values THEN the system SHALL convert to RGB, CMYK, and LAB equivalents
2. WHEN a user inputs RGB values THEN the system SHALL convert to other color spaces
3. WHEN conversions are performed THEN the system SHALL display results immediately
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
5. WHEN conversions are complete THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable accuracy for typical print workflows
