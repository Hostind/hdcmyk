# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LAB Color Matching Calculator is a web-based visual color difference calculator designed specifically for printing professionals. The application enables users to input CMYK values for target colors and sample colors, then calculates and displays LAB color differences with Delta E measurements and CMYK adjustment recommendations. This tool bridges the gap between CMYK ink formulations and LAB color measurements, providing visual clarity and technical accuracy for efficient color matching decisions in professional printing workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to input CMYK values for both target and sample colors, so that I can compare them visually and mathematically.

2. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display input fields for sample color CMYK values (C%, M%, Y%, K%) with 0-100% range validation
3. WHEN the user enters CMYK values THEN the system SHALL validate inputs are numeric and within 0-100% range
4. WHEN the user enters invalid CMYK values THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent calculation
5. WHEN the user enters valid CMYK values THEN the system SHALL display real-time color swatch previews for both target and sample colors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to input LAB values for both target and sample colors, so that I can work with spectrophotometer measurements directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display input fields for target color LAB values (L*, a*, b*)
2. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display input fields for sample color LAB values (L*, a*, b*)
3. WHEN the user enters LAB values THEN the system SHALL validate L* is within 0-100 range and a*, b* are within -128 to +127 range
4. WHEN the user enters invalid LAB values THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent calculation
5. WHEN the user enters valid LAB values THEN the system SHALL update color swatch previews accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to see visual color swatches for target and sample colors, so that I can quickly assess color differences visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid color values are entered THEN the system SHALL display color swatches of minimum 150x150px size
2. WHEN color values are updated THEN the system SHALL update color swatches in real-time
3. WHEN displaying color swatches THEN the system SHALL render colors with accurate sRGB conversion and proper gamma correction
4. WHEN displaying color swatches THEN the system SHALL show target and sample colors side-by-side with visual equation format (Target - Sample = Delta)
5. WHEN colors are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure high contrast and readability under various lighting conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to calculate color differences using industry-standard Delta E formulas, so that I can make objective color matching decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the calculate button THEN the system SHALL calculate CIE76 (ΔE*ab) as the primary color difference metric
2. WHEN calculating color differences THEN the system SHALL display component deltas: ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, ΔC*, Δh
3. WHEN displaying Delta E results THEN the system SHALL show color-coded tolerance zones (≤2.0 = Good, 2.1-5.0 = Acceptable, >5.0 = Poor)
4. WHEN calculating color differences THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy to ±0.01 Delta E compared to industry standards
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show the total color difference prominently as ΔE*ab value

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to receive CMYK adjustment suggestions, so that I can efficiently adjust ink formulations to match target colors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color differences are calculated THEN the system SHALL generate 3-5 alternative CMYK combinations to get closer to target
2. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the system SHALL order options by likelihood of success (smallest adjustments first)
3. WHEN displaying suggestions THEN the system SHALL show complete CMYK values (not just adjustments) for each option
4. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the system SHALL consider ink interaction effects and practical press limitations
5. WHEN displaying suggestions THEN the system SHALL validate all suggestions stay within printable gamut and total area coverage constraints

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to use industry-standard color conversion methods, so that I can trust the accuracy of color calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting CMYK to LAB THEN the system SHALL use industry-standard ICC profile conversion (ISO Coated v2, GRACoL, etc.)
2. WHEN performing color conversions THEN the system SHALL handle ink limiting and black generation properly
3. WHEN calculating color differences THEN the system SHALL reference Bruce Lindbloom's conversion methodologies
4. WHEN displaying colors THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent results across different browsers and devices
5. IF multiple press profiles are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to select appropriate paper/press profiles

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want a single-screen workflow optimized for pressroom use, so that I can efficiently perform color matching without complex navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display all input fields, color swatches, and results on a single screen
2. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide large, clear displays readable from arm's length
3. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL support touch-friendly interaction for tablet use at press console
4. WHEN performing color matching THEN the system SHALL complete 90% of comparisons with minimal clicks
5. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use professional aesthetics consistent with industry color management tools

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to save and recall recent color comparisons, so that I can efficiently work with frequently used colors and maintain workflow continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing color calculations THEN the system SHALL automatically save recent color comparisons to local storage
2. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a history of previous comparisons
3. WHEN the user selects a previous comparison THEN the system SHALL populate all input fields with saved values
4. WHEN working with colors THEN the system SHALL provide preset CMYK colors for common spot colors and brand colors
5. WHEN managing saved data THEN the system SHALL allow users to clear history and manage stored comparisons

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a printing professional, I want to export calculation results and adjustment recommendations, so that I can document color decisions and share information with press operators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL provide export capabilities for print-ready adjustment sheets
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CSV format for batch processing
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create print-ready PDF reports for press documentation
