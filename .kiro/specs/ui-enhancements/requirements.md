# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the user interface of the existing LAB Color Matching Calculator to improve usability, visual appeal, and user experience. The calculator currently has a 4px gradient bar at the top (blue-green-yellow) that needs to be enhanced with functionality, existing tooltips that need improvement, buttons that need better visual styling, and the overall interface needs gold accents for a premium appearance. The enhancements will build upon the existing comprehensive calculator that includes CMYK/LAB inputs, color swatches, Delta E calculations, suggestions, history, export functionality, and PWA capabilities.
